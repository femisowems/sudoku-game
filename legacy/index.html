            <!-- New Game button is technically added by JS in my previous step, but let's standardize and add it here so I can clean up JS later if needed, OR just leave as is. 
                 Wait, my JS looks for #solve-button etc. I should make sure IDs match.
                 In my JS I added New Game button dynamically. I should probably consistency.
                 Let's add it here and remove the dynamic creation line in JS in a future step or just let it double up (bad). 
                 I will update the HTML to include it and then I'll quickly fix JS to not add it if it exists or just rely on IDs.
                 Actually, looking at my JS code: `document.body.insertBefore(newGameButton, solveButton);`
                 I'll add it here and in the next step I might need to tweak JS or just let JS be redundant but safe if I remove the creation logic.
                 Actually, to be clean, I will add it here and I should remove the create element from JS.
